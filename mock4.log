Solution to error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/<repo-name>
This error typically occurs when Git detects a conflict between your local repository and the remote repository on GitHub
1.  Fetch and merge remote change  with `git fetch origin` then `git merge origin/<branch-name>`
2. Pull and rebase: Alternatively, you can use git pull origin/<branch-name> to fetch and merge the remote changes. If you’ve made local changes, you may need to rebase your commits on top of the updated remote branch using git pull origin/<branch-name> --rebase.
- You Neither help even when I ask.. like when I asked you to help me book for the exams you simply answered that was something I was supposed to know, I gues you should have stopped our conversation if I ever said anything like that
- When have you ever cared to give me you .. when ever you saw my mouth was dry
My position relative to you, I told you you made it difficult for me since now am the one putting in the efforts, I dunno whether it’s because you are tired, it’s too difficult or coz you are ashamed of me..

I don’t want you to feel bad coz of me, and maybe to do so I’ll have to stop asking that much from you
