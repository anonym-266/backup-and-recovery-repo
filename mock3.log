Callback function : A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that main function. It's a function that is invoked or executed inside another function, often referred to as a "higher-order function".
History and Reasoning behind the Stratum Hierarchy
The Stratum hierarchy was defined by the Network Time Protocol (NTP) developers, David L. Mills and others, in the 1980s. The goal was to create a standardized way to measure the distance between a time server and the ultimate time reference.
The hierarchy is based on the following principles:
1. Direct synchronization: Stratum 1 time servers are directly synchronized with an external time source, ensuring the highest accuracy.
2. Hierarchical structure: Each Stratum level represents a single intermediate time server, allowing for a clear and consistent measurement of distance from the reference clock.
3. Error propagation: As the distance from the reference clock increases, the potential for errors also increases. The Stratum hierarchy reflects this by assigning higher Stratum levels to time servers with greater potential for error.
4. Practical considerations: The Stratum hierarchy was designed to accommodate the limitations of time synchronization technology at the time. It allows for a clear distinction between time servers with high accuracy (Stratum 1-3) and those with lower accuracy (Stratum 4-10).
The Stratum hierarchy has been widely adopted and is now an industry standard for time synchronization. It provides a clear and consistent way to measure the accuracy and reliability of time servers.

Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of temporarily moving an area's clock forward by one hour during the summer months to make better use of sunlight. This way, people can make the most of the extra daylight during their waking hours.
Applying DST aims to make better use of natural daylight during the summer months when the days are longer. By moving the clock forward, people can enjoy more daylight in the evening, which can lead to:
* Reduced energy consumption
* Increased outdoor activities
* Improved overall quality of life
However, it's worth noting that the sun's rise and set times are determined by the Earth's rotation and orbit around the sun, not by the clock. So, the sun will still rise and set at the same times as before, but the clock will be moved forward to make better use of the extra daylight.
